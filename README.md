# GL-MT3600BE Open Source Build

The `mt3600be-opensource` branch contains the source code, configuration and
build inputs for the GL-MT3600BE open-source firmware. The commercial firmware
history remains available on the `main` branch.

## Contents

- `.config` and `configs/gl-mt3600be-open-source.config`: build configuration
  for the open-source firmware.
- `configs/gl-mt3600be-shipping.config`: shipped firmware configuration,
  retained for version traceability.
- `local-feeds/`: package sources and build dependencies used by this build.
- `local-feeds/SOURCES.lock`: source repository and revision mapping.
- `corresponding-source/`: retained GPL/LGPL source files.
- `package/firmware/mtk-binary-runtime/`: MediaTek runtime IPKs and checksums
  for Linux 5.4.281.

## Build

Use a case-sensitive GNU/Linux filesystem with the standard OpenWrt build
prerequisites installed. Run the following commands from the repository root:

```sh
./scripts/prepare_mt3600be_feeds.sh
cp configs/gl-mt3600be-open-source.config .config
make defconfig
make -j"$(nproc)"
```

The preparation script checks out the pinned feeds and installs the local feed
definitions required by this build. The resulting images are written to
`bin/targets/mediatek/mt7987/`.

The build configuration and pinned source revisions belong to the same firmware
release and should be updated together.

## OpenWrt upstream

OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead
of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully
writable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the
application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you
to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application.
For developers, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having
to build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for
full customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned.

Sunshine!

## Development

To build your own firmware you need a GNU/Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack of a
case sensitive file system.

### Requirements

You need the following tools to compile OpenWrt, the package names vary between
distributions. A complete list with distribution specific packages is found in
the [Build System Setup](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/install-buildsystem)
documentation.

```
gcc binutils bzip2 flex python3 perl make find grep diff unzip gawk getopt
subversion libz-dev libc-dev rsync which
```

### Quickstart

1. Run `./scripts/feeds update -a` to obtain all the latest package definitions
   defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run `./scripts/feeds install -a` to install symlinks for all obtained
   packages into package/feeds/

3. Run `make menuconfig` to select your preferred configuration for the
   toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

4. Run `make` to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build the
   cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the GNU/Linux kernel & all chosen
   applications for your target system.

### Related Repositories

The main repository uses multiple sub-repositories to manage packages of
different categories. All packages are installed via the OpenWrt package
manager called `opkg`. If you're looking to develop the web interface or port
packages to OpenWrt, please find the fitting repository below.

* [LuCI Web Interface](https://github.com/openwrt/luci): Modern and modular
  interface to control the device via a web browser.

* [OpenWrt Packages](https://github.com/openwrt/packages): Community repository
  of ported packages.

* [OpenWrt Routing](https://github.com/openwrt/routing): Packages specifically
  focused on (mesh) routing.
